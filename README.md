# Event Booking System

A full-stack web application that lets users browse and book events, while providing administrative capabilities to manage events, bookings, and user roles. It uses JWT-based authentication with role-based authorization, supporting regular users, pending admins, and confirmed admins.

## Features

* **User registration & login** with JWT-based authentication
* Role-based access control: regular users vs admins
* Browse events with images, descriptions, dates, etc.
* Book events; manage your own bookings
* Admin interface: create, update, delete events; manage pending admin approvals
* File upload support for event images
* RESTful API backend + React frontend
* Uses MySQL database for persistence

## Installation

> These are steps to set up the project locally. Adjust environment variables and configuration as needed.

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/roaa46/event-booking-system.git
   cd event-booking-system
   ```

2. **Setup the backend**

   * Ensure you have Java (JDK 17+), Maven, and MySQL installed.
   * Create a MySQL database (e.g. `event_booking_db`).
   * Copy or create an application configuration file (e.g. `application.properties` or `application.yml`) in the backend module. Set up your DB URL, username, password, JWT secret, and other needed properties.

   Example (in `src/main/resources/application.properties`):

   ```
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/event_booking_db
   spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
   spring.datasource.password=your_db_password

   jwt.secret=your_jwt_secret
   # other JWT / security / file-upload settings
   ```

   * Build and run backend:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. **Setup the frontend**

   * Ensure Node.js (v16+ or whatever version is used) and npm or yarn are installed.
   * Navigate to the frontend folder (e.g. `frontend` or `client`).
   * Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   * Configure environment variables (if any), such as the backend API URL, etc.
   * Run the dev server:

     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

4. **Accessing the application**

   * Frontend UI will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or configured port).
   * Backend API will be available (by default) at `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever port is configured).

## Usage Instructions

* Register as a **regular user** to browse events and make bookings.
* If you wish to act as an admin, there is a flow for admin registration / pending admin approval (depending on how the project is set up).
* Once youâ€™re an admin, you can access event management interfaces: create new events, edit them, delete them, upload event images.
* View your existing bookings under *My Bookings*.
* API endpoints are exposed for login, registration, event CRUD, booking, etc.
